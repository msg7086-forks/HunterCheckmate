# HunterCheckmate

Allows to modify every property of an animal, including fur type. This was done via the ADF files the game uses for storage.

# Note

- This was once a personal project. Expect some things to be buggy and not optimized.
- The code is outdated and hasn't been updated for a long time, thus the values in the source code most likely won't work anymore. It serves as a proof-of-concept and can be updated to work for the latest version if you know where to look.

# Credits

Thanks to `kk94` for releasing the [deca](https://github.com/kk49/deca) tool. The source code was a tremendous help in understanding and utilizing ADF files.
